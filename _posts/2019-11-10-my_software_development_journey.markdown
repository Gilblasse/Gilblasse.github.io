As a child, I enjoyed playing games with my family like checkers, chess, and monopoly. 
During the week, however, my interest was drawn to mysteries. I enjoyed the secret messages, the mystery novels, scooby doo, anything specially shrouded in mystery. My mother, realizing my sudden intrest for mystery, invested in books that guided me into the world of sercrets. It increased my awareness of coded messages, and gradually I began to communicate using invisible ink, ciphers and pig Latin.  

My father also invested his time taking me to a computer science after school program, where I learned about the machine binary system. The teacher, Mr. Green, was excellent in his approach in educating us about the inner workings of a computer. Through games we built our own  progam and  assembled a desktop tower.It was at this point when I realized I wanted to be a computer scientist. As life turns out, I majored in Aviation Maintenance Technology instead.

Years later, I started working with a company called Amazing Grace Mobile Transport. As a driver, we were liable to write down all the trips that had been completed for the day. This included time stamps, the name of the passenger, the medicaid number, the invoice number, the vehicle details used to move the customer and our signature. Not only was this method frustrating, but the use of resources was totally inefficient. 

I then proposed the development of a program that would not only automate this process, but would also improve the efficiency of other procedures. The approach was a mix that used the company's current platform in google sheets and combined it with some javascript magic. When constructing this project It was very challenging, however, Stack Overflow, Youtube, and google script documentations were  my closest friends. it was Scott Adams who said  "There's nothing more dangerous than a resourceful idiot", and I like to think that this is me.

Through this process, I've found my lost passion. In view of the different challenges, I always enjoy my work. Coming to Flatiron has brought my childhood dream to life. I write coded messages, solve mysteries, and have a great time doing it.
